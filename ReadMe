Im begging to learn coding/terminal/git
this also means Im making mistakes
so this message is to my future self..
you struggled alot, and sometimes you didnt think you were doing the right thing
but you made a plan... and stuck to it
You didnt have it all figured out, and didnt have your shit together
you're a doctor, and it gave you the confidence that you can do this
and you did...
So Mikey.. give me my 4 quarters../ please and thank you kindly sir, HAhA
